# Thesis

## Content

### clustermodels

The code in this folder is meant to be a basis for an approach to transform the main code into a modular software. Other than mspecdata.py no code from here was used in the thesis. Therefore, most parts can be deleted or extended if needed.

### data

This folder contains only the testdata

### factories

In the previous approach i wanted to use the abstract factory design pattern for different cluster analyser. This folder was meant to contain the factories. If needed the content can be extended, otherwise deleted.
